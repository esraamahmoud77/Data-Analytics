# Customer Behavioral Analysis & Segmentation

 We will reuse the dataset from Card Loyalty Prediction project, with a different purpose. This project aims to explore unsupervised analysis techniques, including clustering and frequent pattern mining. The goal is to gain insights into user spending behaviors and transaction patterns to understand customer segments and loyalty factors.

## Clustering Analysis

**Q1:** Perform clustering analysis using the K-means method to group users based on their spending behaviors. Determine the optimal number of clusters (K) and create appropriate features for analysis. Interpret the resulting clusters and assess their quality.

**Q2:** Report the statistics of loyalty scores for each cluster of users derived from the clustering analysis.

**Q3:** Discuss the potential benefits of dimension reduction to enhance clustering performance. Explore dimension reduction techniques or alternative clustering methods to improve the clustering analysis from Q1. Evaluate the quality of the resulting clusters compared to those obtained in Q1.

**Q4:** Report the statistics of loyalty scores for each cluster of users obtained from the improved clustering analysis.

## Frequent Pattern Mining

**Q5:** Utilize frequent pattern mining techniques to identify frequently co-occurring transaction types. Justify the selection of the minimum support threshold for mining.

**Q6:** Repeat the frequent pattern mining analysis by segmenting users based on their loyalty scores. Investigate whether different frequent patterns emerge among users with high and low loyalty scores.

## Conclusion

This project aims to uncover valuable insights into user behaviors and transaction patterns through unsupervised analysis techniques. By applying clustering and frequent pattern mining methods, we seek to understand customer segments and loyalty factors, which can inform strategic decision-making for the business.
