However, both models face challenges in predicting the \"NotMentioned\" and \"Contradiction\" classes, as indicated by their low precision, recall, and F1-scores for these classes. Additionally, it is essential to consider the class distribution and data quality when interpreting the results. The models' limitations and strengths should be considered when selecting the most suitable model for the intended application. Further fine-tuning or model architecture modifications may be necessary to improve the models' overall performance on the test data."

      "7. DISCLOSURES REQUIRED BY LAW. If Recipient is requested, ordered or required by a regulatory agency or any other government authority or a court to disclose any Confidential Information, Recipient shall promptly notify Disclosing Party of such request, order or requirement so that Disclosing Party may have the opportunity to contest the disclosure, including seeking a protective order, or waive Recipient’s compliance with this Agreement.

      "15. NO WAIVER. Neither party waives any rights in invention or development lawfully possessed by it at the time of signing this Agreement. In addition, this Agreement does not imply any waiver of any rights or action under the patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret, unfair competition, fair trade or related laws.

The parties agree that each party and its Affiliates may receive Confidential Information from and/or disclose Confidential Information to the other party and the other party's Affiliates, and that all such Confidential Information shall be governed by this Agreement.

      "3. TERM. The term of this Agreement shall be for the Period of Exchange set forth above. Confidentiality obligations shall survive termination of this Agreement for the Period of Confidentiality set forth above unless the Confidential Information is a trade secret, in which case the confidentiality obligations shall continue for as long as the information is a trade secret.

      "4. NOTICE OF UNAUTHORIZED USE. Recipient shall provide written notice to Disclosing Party without undue delay of any misuse or misappropriation of Confidential Information which may come to the attention of Recipient. The Recipient shall cooperate with and aid the Disclosing Party in mitigating and preventing the unauthorized use and disclosure and any furtherance thereof.\n",

      "5.6.3. under those circumstances where Recipient files a lawsuit for retaliation against the Disclosing Party for reporting a suspected violation of law, Recipient may disclose the Disclosing Party’s trade secret information to its attorney and may use the trade secret information in the court proceeding if Recipient files any document containing the trade secret under seal and does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.\n",
      "6. REPRODUCTION AND RETURN OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. The Confidential Information provided by the Disclosing Party shall not be copied or reproduced without the Disclosing Party’s prior written permission, except for such copies as may reasonably be required for the purpose as set forth in Section I of this Agreement. Disclosing Party may serve written request on Recipient for return or destruction of its Confidential Information at any time up to six (6) months after the termination or expiry of this Agreement and Recipient shall, within thirty (30) days of such request or termination, return to the Disclosing Party (or its designees) or certify as destroyed all Confidential Information, in whatever form, including written or electronically recorded information and all copies thereof (other than copies retained in automatic back-up and archive systems), provided however that Recipient shall be entitled to retain one copy of the Confidential Information with its legal counsel or other appropriate corporate representative to evidence the exchange of information hereunder and in connection with legal or statutory requirements. All such retained copies shall remain subject to the use and disclosure restrictions in this Agreement.\n",
      "7. DISCLOSURES REQUIRED BY LAW. If Recipient is requested, ordered or required by a regulatory agency or any other government authority or a court to disclose any Confidential Information, Recipient shall promptly notify Disclosing Party of such request, order or requirement so that Disclosing Party may have the opportunity to contest the disclosure, including seeking a protective order, or waive Recipient’s compliance with this Agreement.

      "8. EXPORT LAWS. Neither party shall export, directly or indirectly, any of the Confidential Information to any country, person or entity which the US Government, at the time of export, requires an export license or other governmental approval without first obtaining such license or approval. The Recipient shall first obtain the written consent of Disclosing Party prior to submitting any request for authority to export such Confidential Information. For the purposes of this Agreement, export occurs when Confidential Information is transferred from one country to another by any means, including but not limited to physical shipments, FTP file transfers, e-mails, faxes, oral transfers or remote server access and an export may also occur when Confidential Information is transferred to or accessed by a person who is neither a citizen nor permanent resident of the country in which such transfer or access is taking place.\n",

The Disclosing Party is not liable under this Agreement for any damages in connection with, related to, or arising out of the use of its Confidential Information.\n",
      "12. NO OBLIGATION. This Agreement shall not be construed in any manner to be an obligation to enter into a further substantive contract or to disclose any particular Confidential Information.\n",
      "13. INDEPENDENT DEVELOPMENTS. Disclosing Party understands that Recipient may develop or have developed information internally, or receive or have received information from other parties that is similar to the Confidential Information. Accordingly, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as a representation that Recipient has not or will not independently develop products that compete with the products or systems contemplated by the Confidential Information provided that it does so without breaching the terms of this Agreement.\n",
      "14. RELATIONSHIP. Each party hereto shall be considered as an independent contractor responsible for its own expenses and financial obligations incurred in the performance of this Agreement.\n",
      "15. NO WAIVER. Neither party waives any rights in invention or development lawfully possessed by it at the time of signing this Agreement. In addition, this Agreement does not imply any waiver of any rights or action under the patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret, unfair competition, fair trade or related laws. Failure to exercise any rights under this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of such rights.\n",
      "16. INUREMENT. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective “Affiliates” (as defined below), successors, assigns and legal representatives. The parties agree that each party and its Affiliates may receive Confidential Information from and/or disclose Confidential Information to the other party and the other party's Affiliates, and that all such Confidential Information shall be governed by this Agreement.

      "17. INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. The parties agree that any use of Confidential Information in violation of this Agreement may cause the other party irreparable harm, and may leave it with no adequate remedy at law and shall, thereby, entitle it to seek injunctive relief in any court with competent jurisdiction over the party or party’s Affiliate in violation.\n",
      "18. CHOICE OF LAW. This Agreement is governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Michigan, without regard to principles of conflict or choice of laws. The Parties hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts of the State of Michigan.\n",
      "19. SURVIVAL. Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 17, 18, 19 and any sections (or parts thereof) which, by their nature, are intended to survive termination shall survive termination of this Agreement.\n",
      "20. SEVERABILITY. If a court finds any provision of this Agreement or any right or obligation invalid or unenforceable, this Agreement shall be immediately deemed amended to: (i) include a provision that reflects the intent of the parties, or, if (i) is not possible, (ii) to exclude such provision and the parties shall negotiate in good faith a substitute provision that reflect the parties’ intent at the time of entering into the Agreement.\n",
      "21. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement contains the entire understanding between the parties regarding the Confidential Information and supersedes all other communications, reports or understandings between the parties in respect thereto. No change or addition to any provision shall be binding unless it is in writing and signed by an authorized representative of both parties.

Receiver shall: (i) hold the Confidential Information in strict confidence; (ii) use the Confidential Information only for the purposes as expressly directed by VIDAR; and (iii) provide such information only to those of its personnel who: (y) have a need to know the same to further VIDAR’s interests; and (z) become a party to and bound by a confidentiality agreement at least as restrictive as this Agreement prior to receiving any such information. Receiver will not disclose Confidential Information to any party who do not meet the preceding requirements. Receiver shall use the same degree of care to protect and safeguard the confidentiality of Confidential Information as it uses to protect and safeguard the confidentiality of its own proprietary information, and Receiver represents, warrants and covenants to VIDAR that such degree of care is reasonably designed to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information.\n",
      "3. Additional Disclosures. Receiver may disclose Confidential Information if the same:\n",

      "4. Additional Receivers. An employee, director, officer, manager, member, partner, affiliate, associate, agent, attorney, accountant, consultant, banker, business adviser, financial adviser, scientific adviser or technical adviser of Receiver may become a party to this Agreement by signing a counterpart hereof, a copy of which shall be provided to VIDAR within five days of signature.\n",

      "(a) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as granting or conferring any rights, interests or intellectual property rights by assignment, license or otherwise, relating to any Confidential Information in or for any intellectual property, invention, discovery or improvement or derivative made, conceived or acquired prior or subsequent to the Effective Date. Except for the limited right to use the Confidential Information as set forth above, all intellectual property, patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and all other rights and interests in the Confidential Information and the products, inventions, ideas, works, creation, symbols, data, reports, opinions and all other concepts and materials developed, invented, reduced to practice, authored or created by Receiver (including portions and derivatives thereof) in any medium arising from or relating to this Agreement (“Intellectual Property”) shall be the sole and exclusive property of VIDAR.\n",

      "7. Disclaimer.

      "THIS NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT (“Agreement”) made this ___________day of _________________, ________________ (“Effective Date”), by and between VIDAR Systems Corporation, a Virginia corporation, with offices in Herndon, Virginia (“VIDAR”), and _________________________________, a _____________________ [corporation/limited liability company/individual], whose address is ______________________________________________________ (“Receiver”).\n",
      "WHEREAS, in the course of its activities with VIDAR, Receiver will receive confidential information about VIDAR, including but not limited to VIDAR’s products (hardware, software and firmware) and its design, engineering, research, development, software, marketing, manufacturing processes, pricing and business plans. Receiver has agreed to receive such information on a confidential basis and to disclose it only as provided for in this Agreement.\n",
      "NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants contained herein, and of other good and valid consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:\n",
      "1. Confidential Information. The term “Confidential Information” means any and all tangible and intangible information disclosed to Receiver in oral, written, graphic, recorded, photographic, any machine-readable or in any other medium or form relating to the intellectual property, management, operations, products, inventions, suppliers, customers, financials of VIDAR or any present or contemplated project, contract or relationship between VIDAR and Receiver, including without limitation, any and all plans, Intellectual Property (defined below), know-how, computer programs, software (source and object code), algorithms, computer processing systems, techniques, methodologies, formulae, compilations of information, designs, drawings, schematics, analyses, evaluations, formulations, ingredients, samples, processes, machines, prototypes, mock-ups, product performance data, proposals, job notes, reports, records, specifications, manuals, supplier and customer lists and information, licenses, the prices it obtains or has obtained for the licensing of its software products and services, purchase and sales records, marketing information or any other information concerning the business and goodwill of VIDAR and any information which is identified as being of a confidential or proprietary nature or should be considered confidential under the circumstances.\n",
      "2. Receiver’s Obligations. Receiver shall: (i) hold the Confidential Information in strict confidence; (ii) use the Confidential Information only for the purposes as expressly directed by VIDAR; and (iii) provide such information only to those of its personnel who: (y) have a need to know the same to further VIDAR’s interests; and (z) become a party to and bound by a confidentiality agreement at least as restrictive as this Agreement prior to receiving any such information. Receiver will not disclose Confidential Information to any party who do not meet the preceding requirements. Receiver shall use the same degree of care to protect and safeguard the confidentiality of Confidential Information as it uses to protect and safeguard the confidentiality of its own proprietary information, and Receiver represents, warrants and covenants to VIDAR that such degree of care is reasonably designed to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information.\n",
      "3. Additional Disclosures. Receiver may disclose Confidential Information if the same:\n",
      "(a) was generally available at the time it was disclosed other than as a result of a disclosure made by Receiver;\n",
      "(b) was known to the Receiver at the time it received such information, as evidenced by contemporaneous documentation in Receiver’s files;\n",
      "(c) is disclosed with the prior written approval of VIDAR;\n",
      "(d) becomes known to Receiver on a non-confidential basis from a source other than VIDAR without breach of this Agreement by Receiver;\n",
      "(e) is disclosed to a third party by VIDAR without restrictions against non-disclosure similar to those contained in this Agreement;\n",
      "(f) is disclosed pursuant to the order or requirement of a court; administrative agency, or other government body, provided Receiver takes all reasonable steps to keep the Confidential Information from becoming part of public records; or\n",
      "(g) is hereafter independently developed by Receiver without the aid, application or use of any Confidential Information;\n",
      "provided for each that: (i) Receiver promptly notifies VIDAR of such action; and (ii) in any action to enforce or remedy a breach of this Agreement, Receiver shall have the burden of establishing the applicability of the subsection on which it relies.\n",
      "4. Additional Receivers. An employee, director, officer, manager, member, partner, affiliate, associate, agent, attorney, accountant, consultant, banker, business adviser, financial adviser, scientific adviser or technical adviser of Receiver may become a party to this Agreement by signing a counterpart hereof, a copy of which shall be provided to VIDAR within five days of signature.\n",
      "5. Intellectual Property\n",
      "(a) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as granting or conferring any rights, interests or intellectual property rights by assignment, license or otherwise, relating to any Confidential Information in or for any intellectual property, invention, discovery or improvement or derivative made, conceived or acquired prior or subsequent to the Effective Date. Except for the limited right to use the Confidential Information as set forth above, all intellectual property, patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and all other rights and interests in the Confidential Information and the products, inventions, ideas, works, creation, symbols, data, reports, opinions and all other concepts and materials developed, invented, reduced to practice, authored or created by Receiver (including portions and derivatives thereof) in any medium arising from or relating to this Agreement (“Intellectual Property”) shall be the sole and exclusive property of VIDAR.\n",
      "(b) All Intellectual Property that are original works of authorship shall be considered works made for hire (as that phrase is used in Section 101 of the United States Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 101 or analogous law). If any Intellectual Property is found not to be a work made for hire and/or is owned by Receiver or any third party, Receiver hereby irrevocably (and shall cause any third party owner to) assigns and transfers all rights to and interests in such Intellectual Property to VIDAR without further consideration.\n",
      "(c) Receiver shall promptly disclose all Intellectual Property to VIDAR and shall make and maintain adequate and current written records of all Intellectual Property. Receiver agrees to take all actions, execute all instruments and fully cooperate with VIDAR, its successors, assigns or nominees in which, in the opinion of VIDAR, are expedient or necessary at any time to file, prosecute, register, evidence, secure, maintain or litigate all such VIDAR rights and interests in the Intellectual Property throughout the world, including all commercial, legal or administrative proceedings involving the same. All expenses of applying for and obtaining such rights and interests shall be borne by VIDAR. VIDAR shall reimburse Receiver for pre-approved expenses paid in connection with such cooperation.\n",
      "6. Return of Confidential Information. Upon the request of VIDAR or the termination or expiration of this Confidential Agreement, Receiver shall promptly return to VIDAR all copies of the Confidential Information and obtained by Receiver.\n",
      "7. Disclaimer. Receiver acknowledges that the Confidential Information may relate to processes or products that are developmental and may or may not have been reduced to practical application in prototype form. Accordingly, Receiver understands that neither VIDAR has made or makes any representation or warranty as to the accuracy, completeness or value of the Confidential Information. RECEIVER AGREES THAT NEITHER VIDAR NOR ANY OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO RECEIVER OR ANY OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES RESULTING FROM RECEIVER’S ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.\n",
      "8. Injunction. Receiver acknowledges and agrees that: (i) the Confidential Information is proprietary to and valuable information of VIDAR; (ii) VIDAR derives economic value from the Confidential Information not being generally known to other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; (iii) any disclosure or unauthorized use of the Confidential Information could cause irreparable harm and loss to VIDAR; and (iv) if this Agreement is breached, VIDAR can not be made whole by monetary damages. Accordingly, VIDAR, in addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled by law or in equity, shall be entitled to an injunction to prevent further breaches of this Agreement and to an order compelling specific performance of this Agreement. Receiver shall reimburse VIDAR for all costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by VIDAR in enforcing the obligations of Receiver.\n",
      "9. General. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia and all actions involving this Agreement shall be brought in the state or federal courts located in the Commonwealth of Virginia, to which the parties consent to jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties, their legal representatives, successors and assigns.

If, in the absence of a protective order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by the DISCLOSING PARTY, the RECEIVING PARTY is nonetheless, in the opinion of counsel, legally compelled to disclose CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION to any tribunal or else stand liable for contempt or suffer other censure or penalty, the RECEIVING PARTY may, without liability hereunder, disclose to such tribunal only that portion of the CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION which such counsel advises RECEIVING PARTY is legally required to be disclosed, provided that the RECEIVING PARTY will cooperate with the DISCLOSING PARTY in seeking to preserve the confidentiality of the CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION before such tribunal.\n",
      "7. No Use. The RECEIVING PARTY understand and agrees that it is not allowed to sell, license or otherwise exploit any parts, products, services documents or information that embody in whole or in part any CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

      "9. Return. All CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION supplied by the DISCLOSING PARTY hereunder and all copies thereof, in whole or in part and on all media, shall be returned to the DISCLOSING PARTY by the RECEIVING PARTY within thirty (30) days upon demand by the DISCLOSING PARTY.

      "11. Injunctive Relief. The RECEIVING PARTY understands and agrees that monetary damages will not be sufficient to avoid or compensate for the unauthorized use or disclosure of the CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION and that injunctive relief would be appropriate to prevent any actual or threatened use of disclosure of such CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.\n",
      "12. Liquidated Damages. In case of unauthorized use or disclosure of the CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, The DISCLOSING PARTY shall be entitled to liquidated damages in the amount of €10 000 (ten thousand Euro) for each such use or disclosure. Notwithstanding the right to liquidated damages, the DISCLOSING PARTY has the right to take any measures available and to claim and receive a higher amount of compensation if the DISCLOSING PARTY can prove that the actual damage sustained will exceed the amount of liquidated damages.\n",

      "WHEREAS, the Contractor has been awarded a contract (the “Contract”) following the solicitation for ________________________________________________________ (Solicitation Title) Solicitation # ____________________; and\n",
      "WHEREAS, in order for the Contractor to perform the work required under the Contract, it will be necessary for the State at times to provide the Contractor and the Contractor’s employees, agents, and subcontractors (collectively the “Contractor’s Personnel”) with access to certain information the State deems confidential information (the “Confidential Information”).\n",
      "NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of being given access to the Confidential Information in connection with the solicitation and the Contract, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which the parties acknowledge, the parties do hereby agree as follows:\n",
      "1. Regardless of the form, format, or media on or in which the Confidential Information is provided and regardless of whether any such Confidential Information is marked as such, “Confidential Information” means (1) any and all information provided by or made available by the State to the Contractor in connection with the Contract and (2) any and all personally identifiable information (PII) (including but not limited to personal information as defined in Md. Ann. Code, General Provisions §4-101(h) and Md. Ann. Code, State Govt. § 10-1301(c)) and protected health information (PHI) as defined in 45 CFR 160.103 that is provided by a person or entity to the Contractor in connection with this Contract. Confidential Information includes, by way of example only, information that the Contractor views, takes notes from, copies (if the State agrees in writing to permit copying), possesses or is otherwise provided access to and use of by the State in relation to the Contract.\n",
      "2. The Contractor shall not, without the State’s prior written consent, copy, disclose, publish, release, transfer, disseminate, use, or allow access for any purpose or in any form, any Confidential Information except for the sole and exclusive purpose of performing under the Contract. The Contractor shall limit access to the Confidential Information to the Contractor’s Personnel who have a demonstrable need to know such Confidential Information in order to perform under the Contract and who are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those set forth in this Agreement. Contractor shall provide copies of such agreements to the State. The names of such personnel are attached hereto and made a part hereof as Attachment I-2. Contractor shall update Attachment I-2 by adding additional names (whether Contractor’s Personnel or a subcontractor’s personnel) as needed, from time to time.\n",
      "3. If the Contractor intends to disseminate any portion of the Confidential Information to non-employee agents who are assisting in the Contractor’s performance of the Contract or will otherwise have a role in performing any aspect of the Contract, the Contractor shall first obtain the written consent of the State to any such dissemination. The State may grant, deny, or condition any such consent, as it may deem appropriate in its sole and absolute subjective discretion.\n",
      "4. The Contractor hereby agrees to hold the Confidential Information in trust and in strictest confidence, adopt or establish operating procedures and physical security measures, and take all other measures necessary to protect the Confidential Information from inadvertent release or disclosure to unauthorized third parties and to prevent all or any portion of the Confidential Information from falling into the public domain or into the possession of persons not bound to maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information.\n",
      "5. The Contractor shall promptly advise the State in writing if it learns of any unauthorized use, misappropriation, or disclosure of the Confidential Information by any of the Contractor’s Personnel or the Contractor’s former Personnel. Contractor shall, at its own expense, cooperate with the State in seeking injunctive or other equitable relief against any such person(s).\n",
      "6. The Contractor shall, at its own expense, return to the State all Confidential Information in its care, custody, control or possession upon request of the State or on termination of the Contract.\n",
      "7. A breach of this Agreement by the Contractor or the Contractor’s Personnel shall constitute a breach of the Contract between the Contractor and the State.\n",
      "8. Contractor acknowledges that any failure by the Contractor or the Contractor’s Personnel to abide by the terms and conditions of use of the Confidential Information may cause irreparable harm to the State and that monetary damages may be inadequate to compensate the State for such breach. Accordingly, the Contractor agrees that the State may obtain an injunction to prevent the disclosure, copying or improper use of the Confidential Information. The Contractor consents to personal jurisdiction in the Maryland State Courts. The State’s rights and remedies hereunder are cumulative and the State expressly reserves any and all rights, remedies, claims and actions that it may have now or in the future to protect the Confidential Information and seek damages from the Contractor and the Contractor’s Personnel for a failure to comply with the requirements of this Agreement. In the event the State suffers any losses, damages, liabilities, expenses, or costs (including, by way of example only, attorneys’ fees and disbursements) that are attributable, in whole or in part to any failure by the Contractor or any of the Contractor’s Personnel to comply with the requirements of this Agreement, the Contractor shall hold harmless and indemnify the State from and against any such losses, damages, liabilities, expenses, and costs.\n",
      "9. The parties further agree that:\n",
      "a. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Maryland;\n",
      "b. The rights and obligations of the Contractor under this Agreement may not be assigned or delegated, by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the State;\n",
      "c. The State makes no representations or warranties as to the accuracy or completeness of any Confidential Information;\n",
      "d. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement;\n",
      "e. Signatures exchanged by facsimile are effective for all purposes hereunder to the same extent as original signatures;\n",
      "f. The Recitals are not merely prefatory but are an integral part hereof; and\n",
      "g. The effective date of this Agreement shall be the same as the effective date of the Agreement entered into by the parties.\n",
